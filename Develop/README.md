# Accessibility 101

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to make caculated changes to the base code of this website.  By using semantic HTML elements and condensing the styling I was able to make the site more user freindly and readable to future developers without cahnging the functionality of the page.

I found this a lot of fun and a very good way to get familair with ways to make the website make more sense to everyone and allow someone with disabilities to interact with the site without any issues.
